void main(){
  // Material App -> parent container : 1
  // Scaffold -> child -> no of screen

  // 1. JIT -> Just in time -> hot reload
  runApp(App());
}



// flutter prefer dart programming language because it has 2 complier : JIT and Ahead of Time
// Flutter is a UI Framework while dart is a programming language
// In flutter everything is a widget. Buttons, text, images, layouts, etc all are widget.
